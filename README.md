# Shielding eyes web app
Simple web app to censor your eyes on profile pictures. Zcash and Zashi style.

Could have bugs. 

Just upload photo, add shielding black bar, resize and rotate. Then save if you are happy with photo.

Could have few bugs where the bar goes missing randomly while moving - just refresh and try again.
